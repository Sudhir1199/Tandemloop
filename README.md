# Tandemloop
## Programming language : Java


#Program1 : creating of class in the name of 'Calculator'
            then create all 4 operators methods which return algorithm.
            then accepting 2 values in main class for calculator with switch case for calling different operators which gives result.
            
            
 #Program2 : Accepting value(n)
             creating "for" loop from 1 to (2*n) 
             then giving "if" condition to provide odd numbers.
             
 #Program3 : Accepting values(n)      
             Creating "if-else" condition
             In "if" : here i provide "for" loop to provide odd number from 1 to 2  (n>=2).         
             In "else if" :
             here i use "for" loop for n greater than 2
             where loop starts from 3 for even n which have "if" condition which gives odd number and also provide algorithm so that it can start from 1.     
                 within this for loop i gives algorithm for else-if to give odd number for odd n.
